# 📷 AIDA: AI Image Detection App

**Building Detection Technologies to Combat Synthetic Media**

AIDA (AI Detection App) is a mobile application that allows users to scan physical artwork and detect whether it was generated by AI. The app utilizes a [U²-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09007) for object isolation, a custom-trained CNN for classification, and [Grad-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) to visually explain results. Unlike typical detectors, AIDA works on second-order images (e.g., photos of prints or posters) that lack watermarks or metadata.

## 📊 Features / Modules

![Skewed images are adjusted using OpenCV to transform images to display as close to square as possible.](assets/ImageSegmentation.png)

![CNN model does binary image classification and is based on a ResNet50 model.](assets/heatmap.png)
